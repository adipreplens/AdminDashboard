## 🔄 **How Our Code Processes Your Data**

### **Step 1: File Upload & Detection**
```javascript
// Backend detects file type
if (fileName.endsWith('.csv')) {
    // Process CSV
} else if (fileName.endsWith('.xlsx') || fileName.endsWith('.xls')) {
    // Process Excel
}
```

### **Step 2: Column Recognition**
Our system is **ultra-flexible** and recognizes many column name variations:

#### **Question Text Recognition:**
- `question`, `text`, `problem`, `content`, `description`, `q`, `qt`

#### **Options Recognition:**
- `options`, `choices`, `option_a`, `optiona`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`

#### **Answer Recognition:**
- `answer`, `correct_answer`, `solution`, `key`, `correct`

#### **Detailed Answer/Solution Recognition:**
- `detailed answer`, `detailed_answer`, `solution`, `explanation`
- `reasoning`, `rationale`, `justification`, `working`
- `step by step`, `elaborate`, `description`

### **Step 3: Data Extraction**
```javascript
const questionData = {
    text: extractText(row, headers),           // → Question text
    options: extractOptions(row, headers),     // → ["Paris", "London", "Berlin", "Madrid"]
    answer: extractAnswer(row, headers),       // → "Paris"
    solution: extractSolution(row, headers),   // → "Paris is the capital..."
    subject: extractSubject(row, headers),     // → "Geography"
    // ... other fields
};
```

### **Step 4: Database Storage**
