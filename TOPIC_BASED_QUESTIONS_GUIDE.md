# ðŸŽ¯ Topic-Based Question Filtering System Guide

## ðŸš€ **Overview**

The Topic-Based Question Filtering System allows users to select specific topics/chapters and get questions from those topics. This system works with your existing admin dashboard database and uses the `tags` field to filter questions by topics.

## ðŸ“Š **How It Works**

### **1. Admin Dashboard Integration**
- Questions are tagged with specific topics in the admin dashboard
- Tags are stored in the `tags` field of each question
- Topics are mapped to subjects and exams based on the Google Sheets syllabus

### **2. Topic Mapping**
Based on the [Google Sheets syllabus](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R15Y5DpUqi6V9dlB3G807mk7rO1G4prRMqKeASllLZ4/edit?gid=0#gid=0), the system includes:

**SSC CGL:**
- General Awareness â†’ History, Geography, Polity, Economics, Science, Current Events
- Quantitative Aptitude â†’ Number System, Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Data Interpretation, Arithmetic
- English Comprehension â†’ Grammar, Vocabulary, Comprehension, Synonyms, Antonyms
- General Intelligence and Reasoning â†’ Analogies, Coding-Decoding, Blood Relations, Series, Syllogism, Venn Diagrams

**RRB JE:**
- Mathematics â†’ Number System, Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Statistics
- Reasoning â†’ Analogies, Coding-Decoding, Blood Relations, Series, Syllogism
- General Knowledge â†’ History, Geography, Polity, Economics, Science, Current Affairs
- Civil Engineering â†’ Building Materials, Structural Analysis, Concrete Technology, Soil Mechanics, Hydraulics, Transportation
- Mechanical Engineering â†’ Thermodynamics, Fluid Mechanics, Strength of Materials, Machine Design, Manufacturing
- Electrical Engineering â†’ Electrical Machines, Power Systems, Electronics, Control Systems, Measurements

## ðŸš€ **API Endpoints**

### **1. Get All Exams with Topics**
```http
GET /topics/exams
```

**Response:**
```json

  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "ssc-cgl": {
      "subjects": [
        {
          "id": "general-awareness",
          "name": "General Awareness",
          "topics": [
            {"id": "history", "name": "History"},
            {"id": "geography", "name": "Geography"}
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### **2. Get Subjects for Exam**
```http
GET /topics/:examId/subjects
```

**Example:**
```http
GET /topics/ssc-cgl/subjects
```

### **3. Get Topics for Subject**
```http
GET /topics/:examId/subjects/:subjectId/topics
```

**Example:**
```http
GET /topics/ssc-cgl/subjects/general-awareness/topics
```

### **4. Get Questions by Topic**
```http
GET /topics/:examId/questions?subject=general-awareness&topic=history&difficulty=easy&limit=20
```

**Query Parameters:**
- `subject` - Subject ID (optional)
- `topic` - Topic ID (optional)
- `difficulty` - easy, medium, hard (optional)
- `language` - english, hindi (optional)
- `limit` - Number of questions (default: 50)

Content-Type: application/json

{
  "topics": ["history", "geography", "polity"],
  "difficulty": "easy",
  "language": "english",
  "limit": 30
}
```

### **6. Get Topic Question Count**
```http
GET /topics/:examId/count
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "general-awareness": {
      "name": "General Awareness",
      "topics": {
        "history": {"name": "History", "count": 45},
        "geography": {"name": "Geography", "count": 32}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## ðŸ“± **Flutter Integration**

### **1. Add Dependencies**
```yaml
dependencies:
  http: ^1.1.0
```

### **2. Use Topic-Based Question Service**
```dart
import 'flutter_topic_based_questions.dart';

// Get subjects for an exam
final subjects = await TopicBasedQuestionService.getSubjectsForExam('ssc-cgl');

// Get topics for a subject
final topics = await TopicBasedQuestionService.getTopicsForSubject('ssc-cgl', 'general-awareness');

// Get questions by topic
final questions = await TopicBasedQuestionService.getQuestionsByTopic(
  examId: 'ssc-cgl',
  subject: 'general-awareness',
  topic: 'history',
  difficulty: 'easy',
  limit: 20,
);

// Get questions by multiple topics
final questions = await TopicBasedQuestionService.getQuestionsByTopics(
  examId: 'ssc-cgl',
  topics: ['history', 'geography', 'polity'],
  difficulty: 'easy',
  limit: 30,
);
```

### **3. Use UI Components**
```dart
// Topic selection widget
TopicSelectionWidget(
  examId: 'ssc-cgl',
  onTopicsSelected: (selectedTopics) {
    // Navigate to question screen
    Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (context) => TopicBasedQuestionScreen(
          examId: 'ssc-cgl',
          selectedTopics: selectedTopics,
        ),
      ),
    );
  },
)

// Question practice screen
TopicBasedQuestionScreen(
  examId: 'ssc-cgl',
  selectedTopics: ['history', 'geography'],
)
```

## ðŸŽ¨ **UI Components**

## ðŸ”§ **Admin Dashboard Setup**

### **1. Question Tagging**
When creating questions in the admin dashboard, add appropriate tags:

**Example Tags:**
- `history` - For history questions
- `geography` - For geography questions
- `polity` - For polity questions
- `number-system` - For number system questions
- `algebra` - For algebra questions
- `building-materials` - For civil engineering questions

### **2. Tag Format**
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `building-materials`
- Multiple tags per question: `["history", "ancient-india"]`
- Be consistent with tag names

### **3. Bulk Upload with Tags**
When uploading questions via CSV, include a `tags` column:
```csv
text,options,answer,subject,exam,difficulty,tags
What is the capital of India?,"Delhi,Mumbai,Kolkata,Chennai",Delhi,general-knowledge,ssc-cgl,easy,"geography,current-affairs"
```
