# AWS S3 Setup Summary

## âœ… Configuration Complete

Your AWS S3 integration is now fully configured and working!

### Environment Variables Set
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_here`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key_here`
- `AWS_REGION=us-east-1`
- `S3_BUCKET_NAME=preplens-assets-prod`

### What's Working

1. **S3 Connection**: âœ… Successfully connected to AWS S3
2. **File Upload**: âœ… Images are being uploaded to S3 bucket
3. **File URLs**: âœ… Files are accessible via S3 URLs
4. **Fallback System**: âœ… Local storage fallback when S3 is unavailable
5. **Health Checks**: âœ… S3 health monitoring is active

### Test Results

- **S3 Upload Test**: âœ… Successfully uploaded test file to S3
- **Image Upload API**: âœ… Successfully uploaded image via API endpoint
- **Health Check**: âœ… S3 status shows as "configured" and "healthy"

### File URLs

Uploaded files are accessible at:
```
https://preplens-assets-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/[filename]
```

### API Endpoints

- **Upload Image**: `POST /upload-image`
- **Delete Image**: `DELETE /upload-image/:filename`
- **Health Check**: `GET /health`

### Security Notes

- âœ… AWS credentials are stored in `.env` file (not in code)
- âœ… S3 bucket is properly configured
- âœ… ACL restrictions are handled (bucket doesn't support ACLs)
- âœ… Fallback to local storage when S3 fails

### Next Steps

1. **Production Deployment**: Set these environment variables in your production environment (Render, etc.)
2. **Monitoring**: Monitor S3 usage and costs
3. **Backup**: Consider setting up S3 bucket versioning for file backups
4. **CDN**: Consider using CloudFront for better performance

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure all AWS credentials are set
2. **Check S3 Permissions**: Verify the AWS user has S3 read/write permissions
3. **Check Bucket Policy**: Ensure the bucket allows uploads
4. **Check Network**: Verify internet connectivity for S3 access

### Files Modified

- `backend/s3Service.js` - Updated to handle file buffers and paths correctly
- `backend/.env` - Contains AWS credentials
- `backend/setup-env.sh` - Script to set up environment variables

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Test S3 upload
node test-s3-upload.js

# Test image upload via API
curl -X POST -F "image=@uploads/test-image.jpg" http://localhost:5001/upload-image

# Check health status
curl http://localhost:5001/health
```
